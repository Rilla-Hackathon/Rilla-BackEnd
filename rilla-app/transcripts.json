        "speaker": "Salesperson",
        "initial": "S",
        "text": "I’m great, thanks for asking. I won’t take up too much of your time. The reason for my call is that I noticed your company, Sarah’s Design Studio, specializes in interior design, right?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "initial": "C",

        "speaker": "Salesperson",
        "initial": "S",
        "text": "Wonderful! At FutureTech, we’ve been helping businesses like yours streamline their project management and improve client communication with our innovative software. I wanted to see if you’d be open to a quick chat about how we might be able to help your team work more efficiently."
      },

        "speaker": "Salesperson",
        "initial": "S",
        "text": "I understand. Many of our current clients felt the same way before they saw what we offer. Just to get a better sense, how are you currently managing your projects and client communications?"

        "text": "That makes sense. And have you noticed any challenges with that setup, like maybe keeping everything organized or spending too much time on administrative tasks?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "initial": "C",
        "text": "Actually, yes. It can get a bit overwhelming, especially when we have multiple projects running at the same time. Sometimes things slip through the cracks, and we have to spend a lot of time following up."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Salesperson",
        "initial": "S",
        "text": "That’s exactly what I’ve heard from many other design studios. Our software helps by integrating all those processes into one platform, making it easy to track project progress, manage client communications, and even automate some of those tedious tasks. This way, you and your team can focus more on the creative work and less on the admin side. Would that be something you’d be interested in exploring?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Customer",
        "initial": "C",
        "text": "It sounds intriguing. How much does it cost, though? We’re a small business, so we have to be careful with our budget."
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Salesperson",
        "initial": "S",
        "text": "Absolutely, I completely understand. Our pricing is quite flexible, designed to suit businesses of all sizes. We also offer a free trial so you can see how it works and determine if it’s a good fit before making any commitment. If you have a few minutes next week, I’d love to set up a demo for you so you can see the platform in action. Would that work for you?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Customer",

        "text": "Perfect! I’ll schedule a demo for Wednesday at 10 AM. I’ll send you a calendar invite shortly. Just to confirm, is your email still sarah@designstudio.com?"
      },
